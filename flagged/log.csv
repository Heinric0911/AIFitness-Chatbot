How often should one exercise?,"The recommended frequency of exercise for most adults is at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week. This can be broken down into smaller chunks of time, such as 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five days a week or 25 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise three days a week.

Strength training exercises should be performed at least twice a week, with one to three sets of 12-15 repetitions for each exercise.

It is important to note that the optimal exercise frequency for you may vary depending on your individual fitness level, goals, and lifestyle. If you are new to exercise, it is best to start slowly and gradually increase the frequency and intensity of your workouts over time. Listening to your body and resting when needed is also important to avoid injury.",,,2024-07-27 23:35:17.514651
